Some **banner** files with a specific graphical template representation using ASCII will be given. The files are formatted in a way that is not necessary to change them. Each character has a height of 8 lines. Characters are separated by a new line \n.
+   [shadow](templates/shadow.txt)
+   [standard](templates/standard.txt)
+   [thinkertoy](templates/thinkertoy.txt)

##  Steps
+   [x] Parse banner files into a character array
+   [x] Split the string to be printed into multiple parts
+   [x] For each part iterate over the character and display it line by line
+   [x] Output
+   [x] Reverse
    +   [ ] " H"
    +   [ ] "  "
    +   [ ] "\n H"
+   [x] Type
+   [x] Align
    +   [x] Center
    +   [x] Right
    +   [x] Left
    +   [x] Justify
+   [x] Color
    +   [x] Name
    +   [x] Hex code
    +   [x] RGB code
    +   [ ] HSL code
+   [ ] Error Handling
+   [ ] Test file
